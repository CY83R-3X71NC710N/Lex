# Lex
Lex is the AI programming assistant done right

# What makes Lex different?:
Lex ensures that you are not copying and pasting code but rather understanding each line, after you ask Lex to generate code only a single line is revealed and you are asked to explain in technical detail what that line is doing to reveal the next.
